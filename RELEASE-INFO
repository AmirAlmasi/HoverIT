This repository contains the release code of the pproject, only the test & integration managers have access to write to this repository.

When code is pushed to this repository Hudson will automatically tag the branch and try to build the code and run all test cases. The 
results of the build together with test coverage data and test results will be published in the project management system.

Before yoou push code to this branch make sure that you have pulled the latest version of the master branch on this repository into 
the branch that you want to push. Make sure that you do not have any conflicts and that the code is working as intended. You must 
be able to build a static library out of the code. It must be possilbe to include and link the built library with all other modules
developed for the same target as your module. Your code should have unit tests that covers most of the code. If possible there should 
be integration tests that can verify that the integration succeded.
